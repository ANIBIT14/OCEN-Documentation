| Credit Product (or Product)      | A credit product (or Product for short) serves as a blueprint outlining the fundamental operations and prerequisites of the offering. Unlike conventional financial products, it encompasses specific combinations of tenure and interest rates directly embedded within the product, rather than presenting them separately. The offer associated with the product will be dynamically generated by the Lender when requested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Product Network / Product Group  | A Product Network is a network established and overseen by the Loan Agent. This network comprises a group of companies collaborating to provide a product tailored for a distinct group of Borrowers (Users) who share a common attribute, such as a geographical location, platform, or other defining characteristic that forms a cohesive cohort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Network Participation Criteria   | A framework of guidelines established by the Loan Agent to foster constructive involvement within the network. This mechanism enables the Loan Agent to ensure compliance with predetermined engagement criteria. For instance, the Loan Agent might stipulate a minimum offer-to-application ratio or impose an upper limit on the permissible interest rate offered through the platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Application Filtering Criteria   | The set of criteria used to screen and select loan applications before they are forwarded to the lender. The responsibility of filtering applications that satisfy the lender's minimum prerequisites falls on the Loan Agent. For instance, if the Loan Agent establishes a loan-offer ratio of 90%, the lender's commitment would involve offering loans for 90% of the applications meeting the criteria. Certain attributes, such as existing bank customer status, might not be known to the Loan Agent, leading the lender to reject an application with an appropriate reason code.                                                      |
| OCEN Registry                    | The OCEN Registry serves as a digital repository comprising two essential elements: Participants, Credit Products (referred to as Products), and the Product Network. This registry is designed to furnish suitable identifiers for each: Product (productId), Product Network (productNetworkId), and Participant (participantId). Notably, a single participant can undertake diverse roles, thus the registry will issue distinct Participant Ids and credentials for each role fulfilled by the participant. These aforementioned identifiers will be included within the OCEN specification, forming a part of every request and response. |
| Auth Service                     | The Auth service is employed to create a bearer token, which is subsequently included in each request along the OCEN Journey among participants. These participants can verify the authenticity of requests by utilizing the public key of the Auth service accessible at a designated endpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
