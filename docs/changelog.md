## Changes in Version 4.0

This is version 4.0 of the OCEN Specification. This is an update to the earlier OCEN APIs Specification v3.3 used by the GST SAHAY pilot.

OCEN v3.3 API Specification is implemented by the LSP and the Lender entities. The entities directly communicate with each other as there is only one LSP in the architecture.

The new OCEN 4.0 version enables multiple participants in the ecosystem across various roles. Additionally, apart from the API specification, this version also includes 3 new components (Auth service, Product registry and Participant Registry) that enable the coordination between the multiple participants in the system.
